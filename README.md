# About

Includes an example scene, background shader and material, parallax glitter material and all needed textures as shown in the example gifs.

Project made using Unity 2018.2.1f1

Included shaders were created using ShaderForge, so if you do have ShaderForge, you can easily look at the node graph to better understand and easily modify as you wish. They are therefore also not optimized for general use, and serve mostly for experimental purposes.
